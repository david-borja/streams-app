## What's about?

Streams is a rudimentary Twitch clone, where users can create streams and watch other users' streams.

It is suggested to use OBS to stream our desktop and audio from our computer to the Node.js implementation of Real Time Messaging Protocol Server (Node-Media-Server).

## Tech

```js
const techUsed = {
  code: ["JavaScript", "JSX"],
  frontEnd: ["React.js", "Redux.js", "Semantic UI", "Flv.js"],
  backEnd: ["Node.js", "JSON Server", "Node-Media-Server"],
  database: "JSON",
  authentication: "Google OAuth",
  httpRequests: "Axios",
}
```
## Next Steps
- Deploy to production
- Add some nicer-looking style
